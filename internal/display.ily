\version "2.19.51"

% Function to enable cross staff stems with varying noteheads.
% (Cross staff only works when the horizontal position of the stems is
%  close enough, which is broken by alternative note heads. The function
%  pushes the note column of the to-be-combined note to a position where
%  the condition is met.)
