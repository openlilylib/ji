% Underlying mathematics

% Convert a ratio to a floating point octave representation.
% A ratio of 2/1 will result in one octave (= 1), 4/1 in two octaves etc.
% Different representations such as semitones or cents should be calculated
% from here.
#(define (ratio->octaves ratio)
   (/ (log ratio) (log 2)))

% Convert a ratio to a floating point step representation.
% The integer part is the number of semitones above the fundamental,
% the fractional part is the fraction of a semitone
#(define (ratio->steps ratio)

% Convert a ratio and return a pair with
% - the pitch in semitones
% - the cent deviation above or below (rounded)
% Rounds to the nearest semitone and gives the deviation
% in cents -49 < cent < 49.
